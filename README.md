# Electronic Erhu

How can a machine replicate the nuances and emotions of human music performance, rather than merely producing standardized sounds devoid of personal touch? Furthermore, how can these machines be designed to harmoniously accompany live human performers? As I embark on this journey, my initial endeavor is to create a machine performer—an electronic string instrument that fuses human touch with control. This foundation will then be enriched with machine intelligence in my subsequent project.

## Project Objectives
### What?
Construct an electronic rendition of the Chinese stringed instrument, Erhu. This version uses a physical bow for input control, outputs in MIDI format, and transmits the data via BLE to a DAW for further editing, mixing, and synthesis.

### Why / Inspirations:
- Using a MIDI keyboard in conjunction with DAW's Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugins presents certain challenges when generating, editing, and mixing a musical track. Playing an instrument digitally using buttons and knobs feels __starkly different__ and __less intuitive__ than the tactile experience of playing a physical Erhu with a bow. Such interfaces often fail to capture the subtle nuances of pitch, tone color, volume, and note articulation. To bridge this gap, I crafted an electronic Erhu that incorporates a __physical bow__, merging the __advantages of digital music__ with the __intuitive control of a traditional instrument__, tailored for human performers.
- The incorporation of physical bow control not only serves the musical purpose but also establishes a foundation for __robotic arm control__. This exploration seeks to understand how an autonomous music machine might keenly __observe and glean insights from the nuanced movements and emotions of human performers__, transcending mere technical precision and embracing the human touch in their performance. How might such machines effectively __track and harmonize with human musicians__ in an orchestral setting? The E-Erhu represents the inaugural phase of my journey to craft a sophisticated machine performer—an electronic string instrument adept at producing music imbued with human finesse and sentiment. This foundation will be further augmented with software-driven mechanical nuances in my upcoming project.
